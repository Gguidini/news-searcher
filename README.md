# News Searcher
Hands-on project for Informational Systems discipline, University of Brasilia, 2018/2.
Completely based on [NewsRanking](https://github.com/icaronr/NewsRanking) by [icaronr](https://github.com/icaronr).

This project is intended to help the [Situation Room](https://fs.unb.br/saladesituacao/) in UnB.
This Room is part of the Health College, and is responsible for monitoring health events nationwide and worldwide.

# Scope of the Project
An important (and time consuming) part of the Room's work is search through the internet for relevant information about health related events.
That information is gathered, processed and analyzed to produce health reports intended to inform health professionals.

This software, which is an upgrade from the original project, [NewsRanking](https://github.com/icaronr/NewsRanking), 
was created to search the web and rank the most recent news that containg relevant information for the reports.
